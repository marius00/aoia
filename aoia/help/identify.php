<h1>AO Item Assistant : The Identifier</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This feature will let you swiftly locate unconverted bio-clumps from aliens 
that turn into specific types. 
It also has a few other select items (like galactic gems) that you can search 
for.</p>

<h2>The GUI Explained</h2>
<p>The GUI is divided into two different lists. The left-hand side list is 
where you select what items you want to search for, and the right-hand side
list is where the results of the search appear.</p>
