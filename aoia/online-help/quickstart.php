<p class="bread">
A short summary of how to get started using AO Item Assistant.<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch AO Item Assistant and Anarchy Online.<br />It is 
recommended to keep it running at all time while playing Anarchy 
Online since this will provide the most accurate recording of your 
items.</li>
<li>After the mandatory database ripping (which may take some time) 
AO Item Assistant is now listening to you Anarchy Online client if it 
is running.</li>
<li>Zone once, and open all backpacks in your inventory. Browse around 
in AO Item Assistant to see matching inventory and equipped items.</li>
<li>Backpacks in the bank doesn't need to be opened, just moved to your
inventory and back into the bank.<br />(Tip: Rightclick backpacks in 
the bank to transfer them to the first available slot in your inventory.)</li>
<li>To search for an item, go to AO Item Assistant Inventory View and 
press CTRL-F. A small input field will become available in the top of 
the view, and you can type in parts of the name of the item you are 
looking for.<br />(Example: Type "Nano%Crystal%(" without the enclosing 
quotes to find all nano crystals. % acts as a wildcard.)</li>
<li>Other plugin tools may be selected by choosing a different tab close
to the top of the main window. Patter Matcher and Player Shop Monitor
are two such tools.</li>
